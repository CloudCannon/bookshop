Feature: Generating Bookshop Components
  As a user who is using a bookshop
  I want a CLI to make new components
  So that I don't have to create all the files myself.

  Scenario: Creating a new Jekyll component from the bookshop
    Given the file tree:
      """
      src/
        component-lib/
          bookshop/
            bookshop.config.js from starters/jekyll/bookshop.config.js
      """
    When I run "npx @bookshop/init --component button" in the src/component-lib directory
    Then stderr should be empty
    And stdout should contain "Created component button in components/button"
    And src/component-lib/components/button/button.jekyll.html should contain the text "c-button"
    And src/component-lib/components/button/button.scss should contain the text ".c-button"
    And src/component-lib/components/button/button.bookshop.toml should contain the text "button"
