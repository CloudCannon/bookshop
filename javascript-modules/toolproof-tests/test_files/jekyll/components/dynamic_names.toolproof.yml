name: Jekyll bookshop tags should support dynamic names

steps:
  - macro: I setup a Jekyll site
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/a/a.jekyll.html" file with the content "🅰️{{include.e}}"
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/b/b.jekyll.html" file with the content "🅱️{{include.e}}"
  - step: I have a "site/index.html" file with the content {html}
    html: |
      ---
      components:
        - _name: a
          e: 🫀
        - _name: b
          e: 🫑
      ---
      {% for component in page.components %}
      {% bookshop {{component._name}} bind=component %}
      {% endfor %}
  - step: I run "cd site && bundle exec jekyll build --trace"
  - step: stderr should be empty
  - step: stdout should contain "done in"
  - step: The file "site/_site/index.html" should contain "🅰️🫀"
  - step: The file "site/_site/index.html" should contain "🅱️🫑"
