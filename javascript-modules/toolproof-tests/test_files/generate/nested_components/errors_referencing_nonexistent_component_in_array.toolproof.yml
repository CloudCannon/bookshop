name: Bookshop nested components - Errors referencing nonexistent component in an array

steps:
  - ref: ./background.toolproof.yml
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/test/test.bookshop.yml" file with the content {yml}
    yml: |-
      blueprint:
        inner: [bookshop:inner]
  - step: I run "npm start" and expect it to fail
  - step: stderr should contain "Component test referenced bookshop:inner, but the component inner does not exist"
