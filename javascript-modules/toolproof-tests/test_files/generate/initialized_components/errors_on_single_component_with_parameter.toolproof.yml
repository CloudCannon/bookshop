platforms:
  - linux
  - mac

steps:
  - ref: ./background.toolproof.yml
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/test/test.bookshop.yml" file with the content {yml}
    yml: |-
      blueprint:
        tag: bookshop:generic/tag!(huh)

  - step: stderr should contain {msg}
    msg: |-
      Single component shorthands cannot have parameters, did you mean to use the bookshop:structure: shorthand?
