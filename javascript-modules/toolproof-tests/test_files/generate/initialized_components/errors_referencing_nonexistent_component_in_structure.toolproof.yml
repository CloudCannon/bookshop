name: Bookshop initialized components - Errors referencing nonexistent component in a structure

platforms:
  - linux
  - mac

steps:
  - ref: ./background.toolproof.yml
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/test/test.bookshop.yml" file with the content {yml}
    yml: |-
      spec:
        structures:
          - blocks

      blueprint:
        inner: bookshop:structure:blocks!(generic/tag)
  - step: I run "npm start" and expect it to fail
  - step: stderr should contain "A blueprint referenced bookshop:structure:blocks!(generic/tag), but the component generic/tag does not exist in the blocks structure"
