name: Bookshop initialized components - Errors on a structure without a parameter

steps:
  - ref: ./background.toolproof.yml
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/test/test.bookshop.yml" file with the content {yml}
    yml: |-
      blueprint:
        tag: bookshop:structure:blocks!
  - step: I run "npm start" and expect it to fail
  - step: stderr should contain "Component test referenced bookshop:structure:blocks! but did not provide a component name as a parameter"
  - step: stderr should contain "Expected bookshop:structure:blocks or bookshop:structure:blocks!(<component_name>)"
