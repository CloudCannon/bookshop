name: Hugo bookshop page building components should work

steps:
  - macro: I setup a Hugo site
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/page/page.hugo.html" file with the content {html}
    html: |-
      {{ range .column_contents }}
        {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
      {{ end }}
  - step: I have a "component-lib/components/tag/tag.hugo.html" file with the content {html}
    html: |-
      tag-{{.tag}}-tag
  - step: I have a "site/layouts/index.html" file with the content {html}
    html: |-
      {{ range .Params.components }}
        {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
      {{ end }}
  - step: I have a "site/content/_index.md" file with the content {md}
    md: |-
      ---
      components:
        - _bookshop_name: page
          column_contents:
            - _bookshop_name: tag
              tag: "contents"
            - _bookshop_name: tag
              tag: "another"
      ---
  - step: I run "cd site && hugo"
  - step: stderr should be empty
  - step: stdout should contain "Total in"
  - step: The file "site/public/index.html" should contain "tag-contents-tag"
  - step: The file "site/public/index.html" should contain "tag-another-tag"
