## v3.6.0 (June 1, 2023)

### Astro Bookshop ðŸš€

This release introduces experimental support for Astro Bookshop sites ðŸ™Œ

We're also transitioning away from the current (intimidating) reference guides in this repository, so all of the details on Astro Bookshop can be found in the new [Bookshop Astro Guide](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/) on the CloudCannon documentation.

### Other changes

* Improved live editing performance for Eleventy and Jekyll sites

## v3.5.1 (May 12, 2023)

* Fixes a performance regression when live editing Hugo with many literal assignments
  * Since 3.4.0 literal assignments such as `{{ $var := "string" }}` caused a significant performance hit. This has now been resolved

## v3.5.0 (May 10, 2023)

This release adds component error boundaries to the Hugo, Jekyll, and Eleventy live editing engines.

Now when syntax errors or unsupported SSG features are used, the individual component should render an error on the page,
and the surrounding components will continue to render correctly. This only applies to the CloudCannon live editing environment,
and does not impact your production website build.

## v3.4.1 (March 23, 2023)

Fixed an error where nested object arrays in a component blueprint would error out.

```yml
blueprint:
  title: Hello World
  nested:
    # `nested` would be made into an array structure with a value matching the below object
    - title: "Nested Object #1"
      double_nested:
        # This would not work and `double_nested` would default to a string array
        - title: "Nested Object #2"
```

This release fixes this behaviour, and deeply nested object arrays will behave as expected.

## v3.4.0 (March 9, 2023)

### New Hugo renderer

The main aspect of this release is a new and improved Hugo renderer when live editing on CloudCannon. Alongside being more reliable, this unlocks many templating functions that were previously unavailable, such as:

* `newScratch`
* `absURL`
* `highlight`
* `humanize`

Additionally, functions that would previously cause a full error (such as `resources.Get`) will now return `nil`, and as such can be handled gracefully inside a component.

Looking forward, this release also paves the path for supporting site actions like `site.GetPage` in the visual editor, as well as using custom non-Bookshop Hugo partials in the visual editor.

As with all releases, your repository can be upgraded to the latest Bookshop by running:
```
npx @bookshop/up@latest
```

### Other changes
* Hugo WebAssembly files are now preloaded in CloudCannon, so loading the visual editor should be significantly faster
* Improved data binding support for Hugo template files, and generally fixed many issues with complex templating
* Reduced noise in the developer console when live editing Hugo Bookshop sites

## v3.3.3 (December 2, 2022)

* Added a `markdownify` filter to Eleventy Bookshop

## v3.3.2 (November 30, 2022)

* Fixes a `v3.1.1` error when running the `@bookshop/browser` command for Hugo

## v3.3.1 (November 29, 2022)

* Fix nested component keys in SvelteKit websites (@NJKode â€”Â #125)
* Stopped loading Hugo WebAssembly files from `cdn.bookshop.build`
  * These are instead compressed and served from the site alongside Bookshop assets
* General repository tidyups and release automation, in preparation for a larger Hugo Bookshop release

## v3.3.0 (August 03, 2022)

### Features & Improvements

* Component Initialization
  * Component blueprints referencing nested components can now initialize those components on creation with the `!` operator. See `Initializing Nested Components` in the relevant guide.
* SvelteKit Beta Support
  * Bookshop now supports SvelteKit, with live editing provided by the existing CloudCannon [Svelte Connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudcannon/svelte-connector).
  * See the newly created [SvelteKit Guide](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/sveltekit.adoc) to get started.

### Fixes & Tweaks

* Fixed some console errors when live editing in Hugo
* Improved the initialization speed of Hugo live editing


## [3.1.3](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/compare/v3.1.2...v3.1.3) (2022-06-17)


### Bug Fixes

* eleventy collection loops no longer crash ([84a64c4](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/84a64c4cb74243d3030373f8f9ddac68c48dfd75))
  * The forloop.name feature implemented in liquidjs has now made it to Eleventy, so the Bookshop workaround has been removed. This workaround was previously causing a crash when nested inside a collection loop.

### Features

* default @bookshop/init to new component if a bookshop dir was found ([12ad117](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/12ad117d188073754c111ea85eccd1e6614d56c7))
  * Previously, running @bookshop/init would prompt you for the decision between creating a new component or a new Bookshop every time. Now, if it find a Bookshop directory it will default to the new component decision.



## [3.1.2](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/compare/v3.1.1...v3.1.2) (2022-05-10)


### Bug Fixes

* set input configuration on generated structures within blueprints ([ed0d6b3](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/ed0d6b339585cb9c505bfbe9451b544e89a12067))
  * Previously, an array of objects within a component would not use a field configured in the `_inputs` block of the component. Any `_` cascade fields are now set on all generated sub-structures in a component.


## [3.1.1](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1) (2022-05-04)

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/compare/v2.6.1...v3.0.0) (2022-04-07)

  * The new configuration files allow for your inputs to be configured using CloudCannon's `_inputs` configuration

  * By using `bookshop:<component>` or `bookshop:structure:<structure>` in your component blueprint, you can nest the blueprint of other components, rather than having to re-specify their fields.

* `npx @bookshop/init` can now generate all supported file formats ([4ab5276](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/4ab52765c2c5c4264fe05a5ad060bd57d84ee136))

  * This requires that a `pathPrefix` is passed to `eleventy-bookshop` in your `.eleventy.js`.

* **jekyll:** The `relative_url` filter is now available to your templates while live editing ([79304cc](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/79304cc0d6c3e49afe2e563fd5158beeb2f1091f))

## [2.4.2](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2) (2022-02-02)


### Features

* **hugo-engine:** implement many transforms for hugo live editing ([98024f8](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/98024f8a80f0737db0866f483e5efd6845fbc286))
    * Now supported:
        * `markdownify`
        * `plainify`
        * `emojify`
        * `htmlEscape`
        * `htmlUnescape`
        * *`highlight`

    * `markdownify` uses a different implementation than hugo,
        so the output is not guaranteed to be identical.

    * *`highlight` is not supported, but will no longer error.
        It will now pass through the input unchanged.
* **jekyll-engine:** implement markdownify for jekyll live editing ([53af90d](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/commit/53af90db0028224bdc7e40e87f8045483293cda9))
    * `markdownify` uses a different kramdown implementation than jekyll,
so the output is not guaranteed to be identical.
