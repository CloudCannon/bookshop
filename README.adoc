[.lead]
Bookshop is a component development workflow for static websites. Bookshop currently supports Jekyll, Eleventy, and Hugo with support for Next, Nuxt, and Svelte coming in the near future.

== Concepts

Bookshop defines a convention for building self-contained components in the templating languages supported by common static site generators. Using these conventions, Bookshop provides developer tooling that empowers you to integrate these components with your stack, build and browse UI components locally, and provide rich live editing experiences for your editors.

A good rundown of our motivations and the problems we are looking to solve can be found in our link:https://cloudcannon.com/blog/introducing-bookshop/[launch post on CloudCannon].
