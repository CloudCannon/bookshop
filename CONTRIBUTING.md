# Contribution Guidelines

## Wayfinding
All npm packages live in a yarn workspace under `javascript-modules` â€” please use yarn over npm commands within here.  
Non-javascript plugins live in the root-level `generator-plugins`

## How it all plugs together
There are a few distinct areas of modules:
* **Core generator plugins**, which provide the following:
  * Core Bookshop component/include tags
  * Bookshop component browser tag
  * _Extra integrations for the component browser, in some cases_
* **CMS generator plugins**, which provide the following:
  * Generation of CMS structured content
  * _Extra helpers for live editing, in some cases_
* **Javascript Tooling packages**
  * Everything around the developer tooling (like the component browser)

## Linting

_TODO_

## Testing

Make sure all dependencies are installed in:
* Repository root
* `javascript-modules` workspace
* Each `generator-plugins/**/*` folder

To run all tests, from the root of the repo run:
```
./scripts/publish.js test
```

This will run all unit tests across all packages, followed by the integration tests in `javascript-modules/integration-tests`
