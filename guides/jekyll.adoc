toc::[]

== Concepts

ifndef::sveltekit[]
IMPORTANT: Migrating from Bookshop 2.0 to 3.0? Read the link:migration.adoc[Migration Guide] first.
endif::sveltekit[]

Bookshop defines conventions for writing
ifndef::sveltekit[]
static
endif::sveltekit[]
components for {ssg}. Using these conventions, Bookshop provides an ergonomic way to build pages out of your components, build and browse these components locally, and generate rich live editing experiences in CloudCannon.

For an example of what this looks like in a real-world example, see our link:https://vimeo.com/689852104[Editing MegaKit with Bookshop] video.

//
// END Concepts
//
//
////

== Prerequisites

* Bookshop requires Node >= 16 installed on your machine.
ifdef::hugo[]
* This guide expects that you already have link:https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/[Hugo] installed on your machine.
* Since Hugo Bookshop utilizes the Hugo module system, the link:https://go.dev/doc/install[Go Programming Language] needs to be installed on your machine.
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
* Currently, Bookshop only supports liquid templating on Eleventy sites. Open an issue if you would like to see another templating flavor supported!
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
* This guide expects that you already have Ruby and link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[Jekyll] installed on your machine.
endif::jekyll[]

== Starting Point

TIP: Short on time? You can use our link:https://github.com/CloudCannon/{ssgl}-bookshop-starter/[{ssg} Bookshop Starter Template] and jump straight into editing it in CloudCannon. Come back here when you want to build it out further, or create your own from scratch.

This guide will walk you through getting Bookshop connected to an existing {ssg} site. If you don't have a site already, 
ifdef::hugo[]
running link:https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site[`hugo new site mysite`] is a good start.
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
running link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/[`jekyll new mysite`] is a good start.

== Creating your Bookshop

The first step is to create the directory structure for your Bookshop. To create this structure, you can run the following command in the root of your repository:

`npx @bookshop/init --new component-library --framework {ssgeng}`

This command should provide you with the following directory structure:

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
component-library/
ifdef::hugo[]
├─ config.toml
endif::hugo[]
├─ bookshop/
│  └─ bookshop.config.cjs
├─ components/
│  └─ sample/
│     ├─ sample.bookshop.yml
ifndef::sveltekit[]
│     ├─ sample.scss
endif::sveltekit[]
│     └─ sample.{ssgext}
└─ shared/
ifdef::sveltekit[]
   └─ {ssgl}
      └─ page.{ssgext}
endif::sveltekit[]
ifndef::sveltekit[]
   ├─ {ssgl}
   │  └─ page.{ssgext}
   └─ styles/
      └─ global.scss
endif::sveltekit[]
----

Here's a quick run-through of what has been generated:

ifdef::hugo[]
config.toml:: This file registers your component library as a Hugo Module. This will allow us to use it as a dependency for your site.
endif::hugo[]
bookshop/bookshop.config.cjs:: This houses the configuration for your Bookshop project, in this case instructing Bookshop to use the `@bookshop/{ssgeng}-engine` package for any live component rendering.
components/:: This is where you will write your component files, a sample component has been added for you.
shared/{ssgl}/:: Any non-component files that you want to be able to use when live editing can be placed here. A page helper has been created, which helps render arrays of components.
ifndef::sveltekit[]
shared/styles/:: Any SCSS files in this directory will be imported alphabetically before component SCSS files. These are used on both the site, and the component browser.
endif::sveltekit[]

== Connecting Your Bookshop to {ssg}

ifdef::hugo[]

Bookshop is distributed as a Hugo Module, so the first step is to make sure that your Hugo site is set up for the Hugo Module system. If there isn't a `go.mod` file in your site root, run `hugo mod init site.local` to initialize this.

With your site ready, we need to pull in the primary dependency of `bookshop/hugo`, as well as the component library we just created.

The following should be placed in your Hugo site config (usually `config.toml` in your root folder).

.*site/config.toml*
[source,toml,subs="attributes"]
----
[module]
replacements = "components.local -> ../component-library"

[[module.imports]]
path = 'components.local'

[[module.imports]]
path = 'github.com/cloudcannon/bookshop/hugo/v3'
----

Adjust the `../component-library` path in `replacements` if you created it with a different name, or in a different place.

TIP: This path is relative to the Hugo `themes` directory (whether or not it exists), hence `../component-library` actually points to a component library in your Hugo source directory.

With that configuration in place, running `hugo serve` should download the required module and host your site. Nothing will appear different yet, but we now have access to use components.

endif::hugo[]

ifdef::jekyll[]

To use Bookshop with Jekyll, the primary dependency is the `jekyll-bookshop` gem.

.*Gemfile*
[source,ruby,subs="attributes"]
----
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-bookshop", "{version}"
end
----

After adding this to your Gemfile and running `bundle install`, specify the path to your Bookshop project in your Jekyll configuration: 

.*_config.yml*
```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-bookshop

bookshop_locations:
  - component-library
```

TIP: Make sure that `bookshop_locations` points to the component library you just created, relative to your Jekyll source.

TIP: If you specify multiple paths, the component libraries will be merged.

TIP: Paths that don't exist will be skipped. If you specify local and production paths, the one that exists will be used.

With that configuration in place, running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should should succeed. Nothing will appear different yet, but we now have access to use components.

endif::jekyll[]

ifdef::eleventy[]

To use Bookshop with Eleventy, the primary dependency is the `@bookshop/eleventy-bookshop` npm package.

.*command*
```bash
# npm
npm i --save-exact @bookshop/eleventy-bookshop

# or yarn
yarn add --exact @bookshop/eleventy-bookshop
```

Within your Eleventy config, specify the path to your Bookshop project. 

TIP: If you specify multiple paths, the components will be merged.

TIP: Paths that don't exist will be skipped. If you specify local and production paths, the one that exists will be used.

IMPORTANT: The pathPrefix provided must match the pathPrefix configured in your `.eleventy.js`. If you aren't using the `url` filter anywhere, this option can be omitted.

.*.eleventy.js*
```javascript
const pluginBookshop = require("@bookshop/eleventy-bookshop");

module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  // ...

  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginBookshop({
    bookshopLocations: ["component-library"],
    pathPrefix: '',
  }));

  // ...
};
```

TIP: Make sure that `bookshop_locations` points to the component library you just created, relative to your Eleventy source.

endif::eleventy[]


ifdef::sveltekit[]

To use Bookshop with SvelteKit, the primary dependency is the `@bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop` npm package.

.*command*
```bash
# npm
npm i --save-exact @bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop

# or yarn
yarn add --exact @bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop
```

Within your Vite config, specify a `$bookshop` alias with the path to your Bookshop project. 

.*vite.config.js*
```javascript
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { resolve } from 'path';

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
    plugins: [sveltekit()],
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            $bookshop: resolve('./component-library/')
        }
    },
    server: {
        fs: {
            // Allow serving files from one level up to the project root
            allow: ['..'],
        },
    },
};

export default config;
```

TIP: Make sure that `$bookshop` points to the component library you just created, relative to your SvelteKit source.

TIP: `allow: ['..']` in the `server.fs` configuration allows Vite to serve the component files. This will need to be adusted to include your component library if it exists in another location.

endif::sveltekit[]

Lastly, we'll need to install a few npm packages for Bookshop. These aren't used as part of your production build, but they provide the developer tooling that enables structured data and live editing. 

These packages should be installed at the root of the repository that contains your site. If this folder doesn't have a `package.json` file yet, run `npm init -y` to create one.

To get setup, run the following command to install the needed Bookshop packages:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
# npm
npm i --save-exact @bookshop/generate @bookshop/browser @bookshop/{ssgeng}-engine

# or yarn
yarn add --exact @bookshop/generate @bookshop/browser @bookshop/{ssgeng}-engine
----

IMPORTANT: Bookshop uses a fixed versioning scheme, where all packages are released for every version. It is recommended that you keep the npm packages and your plugins at the same version. To help with this, you can run `npx @bookshop/up@latest` from your repository root to update all Bookshop packages in sync.

// END Connecting Your Bookshop

== Using Components in {ssg}

If you ran the `@bookshop/init` command earlier, you should see that you now have a file at `components/sample/sample.{ssgext}`. Let's have a go using that component somewhere on our site.

ifndef::sveltekit[]
TIP: Bookshop supports multiple SSG targets, which is why we denote this as `.{ssgext}`.
endif::sveltekit[]

TIP: We'll cover creating these components soon — if you want to add a new component now, you can run `npx @bookshop/init --component <name>` in your Bookshop directory to scaffold it out automatically.

// JEKYLL
ifdef::jekyll[]

Bookshop provides the `bookshop` tag to include components, which functions the same as using a normal Jekyll include.

To start, add the following snippet to one of your layouts:

.*index.html*
```liquid
...

{% bookshop sample text="Hello from the sample component" %}

...
```

If you now load your Jekyll site in a browser, you should see the sample component rendered on the page. There won't be any styles yet, we'll cover that soon. First though, there are a few neater ways you can use the `bookshop` tag:

=== Alternate syntax

Passing a set of parameters to a component can be cumbersome, and these will often point to front matter objects. Consider the following example:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop hero hero_text=page.component.hero_text image=page.component.image %}
```

Having to pass through `hero_text` and `image` individually isn't very maintainable, so instead you can use:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop hero bind=page.component %}
```

The `bind` parameter is provided by Bookshop. This works like the spread operator in Javascript, by passing all the keys of the object to the component as props.

TIP: If you're used to a framework like Svelte, this is the equivalent of `<Component {...props} />`

Bookshop tags also support interpolating liquid, so if you have your component name in a variable you can use:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  _bookshop_name: hero
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop {{page.component._bookshop_name}} bind=page.component %}
```

endif::jekyll[]
// /JEKYLL
// ELEVENTY
ifdef::eleventy[]

Bookshop provides the `bookshop` tag to include components, which functions the same as using a normal Eleventy include.

To start, add the following snippet to one of your layouts:

.*index.html*
```liquid
...

{% bookshop "sample" text: "Hello from the sample component" %}

...
```

If you now load your Eleventy site in a browser, you should see the sample component rendered on the page. There won't be any styles yet, we'll cover that soon. First though, there are a few neater ways you can use the `bookshop` tag:

=== Alternate syntax

Passing a set of parameters to a component can be cumbersome, and these will often point to front matter objects. Consider the following example:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop "hero" hero_text: component.hero_text image: component.image %}
```

Having to pass through `hero_text` and `image` individually isn't very maintainable, so instead you can use:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop "hero" bind: component %}
```

The `bind` parameter is provided by Bookshop. This works like the spread operator in Javascript, by passing all the keys of the object to the component as props.

TIP: If you're used to a framework like Svelte, this is the equivalent of `<Component {...props} />`

Bookshop tags also support interpolating liquid, so if you have your component name in a variable you can use:

.*index.html*
```liquid
---
component:
  _bookshop_name: hero
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  image: /image.png
---
{% bookshop "{{page.component._bookshop_name}}" bind: component %}
```

endif::eleventy[]
// /ELEVENTY
// HUGO
ifdef::hugo[]

Bookshop provides a range of partials which we will cover. The most important of these is the default `bookshop` partial that we will use to access our components. 

To start, add the following snippet to one of your layouts:

.*index.html*
[source,go,subs="attributes"]
----
...

{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "sample" (dict "text" "Hello from the sample component")) }}

...
----

This partial expects a slice where the first element is the Bookshop name of a component, and the second element contains the arguments to that component.

If you now load your Hugo site in a browser, you should see the sample component rendered on the page. There won't be any styles yet, we'll cover that soon. First though, there are a few neater ways you can use the `bookshop` partial:

=== Alternate syntax

Writing a Hugo `dict` by hand can be cumbersome, and these will often point to front matter objects. If you have the front matter:

.*index.md*
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
sample:
  text: Hello World
----

Then you can replace the partial we just wrote with the following: 

.*index.html*
[source,go,subs="attributes"]
----
...

{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "sample" .Params.sample) }}

...
----

To go one step further, you can add the key `_bookshop_name` to this object:

.*index.md*
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
sample:
  _bookshop_name: sample
  text: Hello World
----

Which lets us pass the object directly to the `bookshop` partial: 

.*index.html*
[source,go,subs="attributes"]
----
...

{{ partial "bookshop" .Params.sample }}

...
----

endif::hugo[]
// /HUGO
// SVELTEKIT
ifdef::sveltekit[]

Bookshop provides a `Bookshop` wrapper to render components. To start, add the following snippet to one of your pages:

.*index.svelte*
```svelte
...

<script>
	import { Bookshop } from "@bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop";
</script>

<div>
	<Bookshop component="sample" text="Hello from the sample component" />
</div>

...
```

If you now load your SvelteKit site in a browser, you should see the sample component rendered on the page.

endif::sveltekit[]
// /SVELTEKIT

TIP: The Bookshop name of a component is the path to its directory. +
So the name for `components/sample/sample.{ssgext}` is `sample`, +
and the name for `components/generic/button/button.{ssgext}` would be `generic/button`.

TIP: The structures generated by Bookshop for CloudCannon include a `_bookshop_name` field for you, which can be used to render components dynamically. We'll cover this a bit later on in <<Connecting Bookshop to CloudCannon>>.

=== Using Shared Bookshop Helpers in {ssg}

Shared Bookshop helpers can be placed in the `shared/{ssgl}` directory. i.e:
[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
component-library/
├─ components/
└─ shared/
  └─ {ssgl}/
    └─ helper.{ssgext}
----

ifdef::hugo[]
This can then be included using the `bookshop_partial` partial:
```go
{{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "helper" (dict "lorem" "ipsum")) }}
```

The arguments are the same as the `bookshop` partial. This is otherwise a standard Hugo partial, with the extra feature that it can be used anywhere within your Hugo site _or_ your components.
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
This can then be included using the `bookshop_include` tag:
```liquid
{% bookshop_include helper lorem="ipsum" %}
```

The format is the same as the `bookshop` tag. This is otherwise a standard Jekyll include, with the extra feature that it can be used anywhere within your Jekyll site _or_ your components.
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
This can then be included using the `bookshop_include` tag:
```liquid
{% bookshop_include "helper" lorem: "ipsum" %}
```

The format is the same as the `bookshop` tag. This is otherwise a standard Eleventy include, with the extra feature that it can be used anywhere within your Eleventy site _or_ your components.
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]
This can then be included using Bookshop wrapper with the `shared` prop:
```svelte
<Bookshop shared="helper" lorem="ipsum" />
```
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
NOTE: While developing locally, components will have access to the rest of your site. This isn't true when live editing, which is why these helper files exist.
endif::sveltekit[]

You will notice that `@bookshop/init` created a `page.{ssgext}` file for you. Given the following front matter:

```yaml
content_blocks:
  - _bookshop_name: hero
    hero_text: Hello World
    image: /image.png
  - _bookshop_name: cta
    heading: Join our newsletter
    location: /signup
```

You can render the array of components using the page helper like so:

ifdef::hugo[]

```go
{{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "page" .Params.content_blocks) }}
```

endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]

```liquid
{% bookshop_include page content_blocks=page.content_blocks %}
```

endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]

```liquid
{% bookshop_include "page" content_blocks: content_blocks %}
```

endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]

```svelte
<Bookshop shared="page" {content_blocks} />
```

endif::sveltekit[]

This will loop through the given array, and render each component according to its `_bookshop_name` key.

Give this a try now — replace the sample component you added with the `page` helper, and add the following to your front matter:

```yaml
content_blocks:
  - _bookshop_name: sample
    text: A sample example
  - _bookshop_name: sample
    text: A second sample example
```

ifndef::sveltekit[]
IMPORTANT: It is essential to render arrays of components using the page helper. Live editing only works within Bookshop components and helpers, so using this method means that rearranging and adding new components will work in the Visual Editor.
endif::sveltekit[]

////
//
//
// END Using Shared Bookshop Helpers
//
//
////

== Importing Bookshop Styles

ifdef::sveltekit[]
In other SSGs Bookshop supports a `<component>.scss` alongside each component. 

Since Svelte supports styles inside component files, you can continue to use your existing setup for styles.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
Bookshop provides some helpers for including the component and global styles that you defined in your component library. 

NOTE: Locating styles inside your Bookshop is optional — you can always define them with the rest of your site — but authoring your styles in your component library will provide a better experience when we cover using the local component browser.

`@bookshop/init` created a `sample.scss` file for you at `components/sample/sample.scss`. This file will currently be empty, but you should add a style here to test that the Bookshop SCSS integration is working for you. Something like:

```css
.c-sample {
  background-color: blanchedalmond;
}
```

ifdef::hugo[]

To include all of your Bookshop styles in Hugo, you can use the `bookshop_scss` partial in your `baseof.html` layout. This partial returns a slice of all SCSS files, which can then be included into your existing Hugo resource pipeline:

.*baseof.html*
```liquid
{{ $bookshop_scss_files := partial "bookshop_scss" . }}
{{ $scss := $bookshop_scss_files | resources.Concat "css/bookshop.css" | resources.ToCSS | resources.Minify |
    resources.Fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $scss.Permalink }}">
```

endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]

To import styles in Jekyll, Bookshop provides the tag `{% bookshop_scss %}` to be used in your main SCSS file. For example:

.*assets/main.scss*
```liquid
---
# Front matter dashes for Jekyll to process the file
---

{% bookshop_scss %} // Import all bookshop styles

```

This bundles all Bookshop SCSS files into the Jekyll Sass pipeline.

endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]

To use Bookshop styles on your website, you can run the `bookshop-sass` command provided by `@bookshop/sass`.

.*command*
```bash
npm i -D @bookshop/sass
# or
yarn add -D @bookshop/sass

# then

npx @bookshop/sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css
```

From within your `package.json` file you can add the script as: 
```
"sass:build": "bookshop-sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css",
"sass:watch": "bookshop-sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css -w"
```

This compiles all styles from the Bookshop (including running any Postcss plugins you have configured in your working directory), and outputs a css file ready to be referenced on your website.

Reference `npx @bookshop/sass --help` to see the available options.

endif::eleventy[]

IMPORTANT: Bookshop SCSS files are loaded in order of all shared files, followed by all component files, alphabetically.

endif::sveltekit[]

////
//
//
// END Importing Bookshop Styles
//
//
////

== Authoring New Components

TIP: To create new components, you can simply run `npx @bookshop/init --component <name>` in an existing Bookshop

Components live within the `components/` directory, each inside a folder bearing their name. A component is defined with a `<name>.bookshop.<format>` file. This file serves as the schema for the component, defining which properties it may be supplied.

Components may also be nested within folders, which are then referenced as part of the component name. For example, the following structure would define the components `hero`, `button/large` and `button/small`:

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
components/
├─ hero/
|  |  hero.bookshop.yml
|  └─ hero.{ssgext}
└─ button/
   ├─ large/
   |  |  large.bookshop.yml
   │  └─ large.{ssgext}
   └─ small/
      |  small.bookshop.yml
      └─ small.{ssgext}
----

////
//
//
// END Authoring New Components
//
//
////

=== Authoring Component Template Files

Beyond the naming convention, Bookshop template files are what you would expect when working with {ssg}. A basic button component might look like the following:

.*components/button/button.{ssgext}*
ifdef::hugo[]
[source,liquid]
----
<a class="c-button" href="{{ .link_url }}">{{ .link_text }}</a>
----
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
[source,liquid]
----
<a class="c-button" href="{{ include.link_url }}">{{ include.link_text }}</a>
----
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
[source,liquid]
----
<a class="c-button" href="{{ link_url }}">{{ link_text }}</a>
----
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]
[source,svelte]
----
<script>
  export let link_url;
  export let link_text;
</script>

<a class="c-button" href={ link_url }>{ link_text }</a>
----
endif::sveltekit[]

Components can, of course, reference other components:

.*components/hero/hero.{ssgext}*
ifdef::hugo[]
[source,go]
----
<h1>{{ .hero_text }}</h1>
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "button" (dict "link_url" .url "link_text" "Click me")) }}
----
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
[source,liquid]
----
<h1>{{ include.hero_text }}</h1>
{% bookshop button link_url=include.link_url link_text="Click me" %}
----
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
[source,liquid]
----
<h1>{{ hero_text }}</h1>
{% bookshop "button" link_url: link_url link_text: "Click me" %}
----
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]
[source,svelte]
----
<script>
  import { Bookshop } from "@bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop";

  export let hero_text;
  export let link_url;
</script>

<h1>{ hero_text }</h1>

=== Authoring Component Bookshop Files

The Bookshop file for each component is the most important piece of the Bookshop ecosystem. This file drives the Structured Data in CloudCannon, the local component browser, and Bookshop's live editing. +
The `sample.bookshop.yml` file that our init command generated contains the following:

++++
<details><summary>sample.bookshop.yml</summary>
++++


```yaml
# Metadata about this component, to be used in the CMS
spec:
  structures:
    - content_blocks
  label: Sample
  description:
  icon:
  tags:

# Defines the structure of this component, as well as the default values
blueprint:
  text: "Hello World!"

# Overrides any fields in the blueprint when viewing this component in the component browser
preview:

# Any extra CloudCannon inputs configuration to apply to the blueprint
_inputs: {}
```

++++
</details>
++++

Let's walk through an example file section by section to understand what's going on.

////
//
//
// END Authoring Component Bookshop Files
//
//
////

==== Component Spec

```yaml
spec:
  structures:
    - content_blocks
  label: Example
  description: An example Bookshop component
  icon: book
  tags:
    - example
```

This section is used when creating the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/defining-what-adds-to-an-array-with-array-structures/?ssg={ssg}#structures[Structure] for your component. The `structures` array defines which structure keys to register this component with. In other words, with the above snippet, this component will be one of the options within an array named `content_blocks`, or another input configured to use `_structures.content_blocks`.

The other keys are used when the component is displayed in CloudCannon or in the Bookshop Component Browser. `icon` should be the name of a suitable link:https://strict-hanger.cloudvent.net/[material icon] to use as the thumbnail for your component.

////
//
//
// END Component Spec
//
//
////

==== Component Blueprint

```yaml
blueprint:
  text: Hello World!
```

The blueprint is the primary section defining your component. This will be used as the intitial state for your component when it is added to a page, and should thus include all properties used in your template.

////
//
//
// END Component Blueprint
//
//
////

==== Component Preview

```yaml
preview:
  text: Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.
```

Your blueprint represents the initial state of your component, but in the component browser you might want to see a preview of your component filled out with example data.

The preview object will be merged with your blueprint before a component is rendered in the component browser. This is a deep merge, so given the following specification:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  cta:
    button_text: ""
    button_url: "#"

preview:
  cta:
    button_text: "Click me"
```

Your component preview data will be:

```yaml
hero_text: "Hello World"
cta:
  button_text: "Click me"
  button_url: "#"
```

NOTE: In a future Bookshop release, component thumbnails will be automatically generated. This will also use the preview object.

////
//
//
// END Component Preview
//
//
////

==== Inputs Configuration

```yaml
_inputs: 
  text:
    type: "html"
    comment: "This comment will appear in the CMS"
```

The `_inputs` section of your Bookshop file can be used to configure the keys in your blueprint. This object is passed through unaltered to CloudCannon, so see the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/?ssg={ssg}[CloudCannon Inputs Documentation] to read more.

This configuration is scoped to the individual component, so you can configure the same key differently across components — even if the components are nested within one another.

////
//
//
// END Inputs Configuration
//
//
////

==== Blueprint Arrays

Arrays of objects in your blueprint will be transformed into CloudCannon Structures automatically, and initialized as empty arrays. Using the following Blueprint:

```yaml
blueprint:
  text: Sample Text
  items:
    - item_content: Hello World
```

A new component added to the page will take the form:

```yaml
text: Sample Text
items: []
```

Editors will then be able to add and remove objects to the `items` array.

////
//
//
// END Blueprint Arrays
//
//
////

==== Nesting Components

Your blueprint can reference other components and structures to create rich page builder experiences:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button
```

In this example, the `button` key will become an Object Structure containing the values specified in your `button` component blueprint. If you desired an array of buttons, you could use the following:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  buttons: [bookshop:button]  # equivalent
  buttons:
    - bookshop:button         # equivalent
```

If you're creating a layout component, you likely want to support a set of components. For this, you can reference the keys we defined in `spec.structures` as such:

```yaml
blueprint:
  section_label: My Section

  # Make header a single component that can be selected from the content_blocks set
  header: bookshop:structure:content_blocks

  # Make inner_components an array that can contain components marked content_blocks
  inner_components: [bookshop:structure:content_blocks]
```

To give a concrete example, say we have the following `hero.bookshop.yml` file:

```yaml
spec:
  structures: [content_blocks]

blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  cta_button: bookshop:button
  column_components: [bookshop:structure:content_blocks]
```

Then our `hero.{ssgext}` file to render this might look like the following:

ifdef::hugo[]
[source,go]
----
<div class="hero">
  <h1>{{ .hero_text }}</h1>
  {{ with .cta_button }}
    {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
  {{ end }}
  <div class="column">
    {{ range .column_components }}
      {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
    {{ end }}
  </div>
</div>
----
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
[source,liquid]
----
<div class="hero">
  <h1>{{ include.hero_text }}</h1>
  {% if include.cta_button %}
    {% bookshop button bind=include.cta_button %}
  {% endif %}
  {% for component in include.column_components %}
    {% bookshop {{ component._bookshop_name }} bind=component %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
----
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
[source,liquid]
----
<div class="hero">
  <h1>{{ hero_text }}</h1>
  {% if cta_button %}
    {% bookshop "button" bind: cta_button %}
  {% endif %}
  {% for component in column_components %}
    {% bookshop "{{ component._bookshop_name }}" bind: component %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
----
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]
[source,svelte]
----
<script>
  import { Bookshop } from "@bookshop/sveltekit-bookshop";

  export let hero_text;
  export let cta_button;
  export let column_components;
</script>

<div class="hero">
  <h1>{ hero_text }</h1>
  {#if cta_button}
    <Bookshop component="button" {...cta_button} />
  {/if}
  {#each column_components as component}
    <Bookshop {...component} />
  {/each}
</div>
----
endif::sveltekit[]

IMPORTANT: Object Structures in CloudCannon may be empty, so testing for the existence of this component in your template is recommended.

==== Initializing Nested Components

By default, nested components using the `bookshop:` shorthand will be initialized empty. For example, the blueprint:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button
```

Will be initialized in CloudCannon as:

```yaml
hero_text: Hello World
button:
```

Where `button` will provide an editor with the option to add a button component. To instead have the button component exist on creation, you can use the syntax `bookshop:button!`:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button!
```

The same setting can be applied to a structure shorthand by specifying the component that should be initialized. Taking the following example:

```yaml
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  column_components: 
    - bookshop:structure:content_blocks!(hero)
    - bookshop:structure:content_blocks!(button)
```

This will be initialized in CloudCannon as:

```yaml
hero_text: Hello World
column_components: 
  - _bookshop_name: hero
    # hero fields
  - _bookshop_name: button
    # button fields
```

Where `column_components` can be then further added to/removed from by an editor, as per the tagged structure.

////
//
//
// END Nesting Components
//
//
////

==== Supported File Formats

TIP: When you run `npx @bookshop/init --component <name>` you will be prompted to pick which configuration format you want to create the component with.

In the examples above, we have been writing the Bookshop configuration files using YAML. This is the recommended format, but you can also choose another if you prefer. Here is a real-world example of a component written in each supported format:

++++
<details><summary>hero.bookshop.yml</summary>
++++


```yaml

=== Providing Custom Component Thumbnails
When an editor is selecting a component in CloudCannon, the `icon` from the component spec will be used as the thumbnail. You can provide a custom image to use instead by placing a `<component>.preview.<format>` in your component directory. To provide a custom icon, which will be shown when viewing an array of components, you can also provide a `<component>.icon.<format>` file.

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
components/
└─ hero/
   |  hero.bookshop.yml
   ├─ hero.preview.png
   ├─ hero.icon.svg
   └─ hero.{ssgext}
----

See the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/array-structures-reference/?ssg={ssg}[CloudCannon Structures Reference] for extra keys that you can set in your component spec to control the display of these images.

ifdef::hugo[]
WARNING: Make sure that the `config.toml` file in your Bookshop has `includeFiles = ["**/*.hugo.html"]` alongside the `layouts` mount. +
If this isn't present, run `npx @bookshop/up@latest` in your component library to migrate this file. +
Without this configuration, your Hugo build will error when it enounters an image file in this directory.
endif::hugo[]

== Using the Bookshop Component Browser
The Bookshop component browser allows you to browse and experiment with your components. When running in development the component browser also provides hot reloading of component templating and styles. An example browser showing the components in our Eleventy starter template can be seen here: https://winged-cat.cloudvent.net/components/

In your local development environment, run: +
`npx @bookshop/browser`

By default, this will discover any Bookshop directories in or under the current working directory, and will host a component library on port 30775.

After running this command, a component browser will be viewable on http://localhost:30775

TIP: Run `npx @bookshop/browser --help` to see the available options.

=== Integrating the Component Browser With Your Site

ifdef::sveltekit[]
*Coming Soon* — Bookshop {ssg} does not yet support embedding the Bookshop browser in a website.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]

*Coming Soon* — Bookshop {ssg} provides a helper for embedding the Bookshop browser in your website. This references the component browser started in the previous command, and embeds a live copy into your website.

This allows you to:

* Rely on your site layouts and styles in your component
* Host a component browser on a page of your built site

ifdef::hugo[]
To install the component browser on a page of your site, use the `bookshop_component_browser` partial in that page's layout.

.*components.html*
```go
{{ partial "bookshop_component_browser" }}
```

endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
To install the component browser on a page of your site, use the `bookshop_component_browser` tag in that page's layout.

.*components.html*
```liquid
{% bookshop_component_browser %}
```

endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
To install the component browser on a page of your site, use the `bookshop_component_browser` tag in that page's layout.

.*components.html*
```liquid
{% bookshop_component_browser %}
```

endif::eleventy[]

If you're running {ssg} locally, open another terminal and run `npx @bookshop/browser` in your Bookshop, or a parent directory. You should now be able to visit the page that you installed the component browser on, and see your components in a playground environment.

TIP: If you're running the browser command on a custom port, you can pass that port as an argument with
ifdef::hugo[]
`{{ partial "bookshop_component_browser" 1234 }}`
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
`{% bookshop_component_browser 1234 %}`
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
`{% bookshop_component_browser 1234 %}`
endif::eleventy[]

endif::sveltekit[]

=== Hosting a Component Library

ifdef::sveltekit[]
Bookshop {ssg} does not yet support hosting the Bookshop browser on a SvelteKit website.
endif::sveltekit[]
ifndef::sveltekit[]
Any page that contains the `bookshop_component_browser` snippet will get picked up by `npx @bookshop/generate` (See <<Connecting Bookshop to CloudCannon>>) and turned into a hosted component browser, no extra configuration is needed.
endif::sveltekit[]

////
//
//
// END Hosting a Component Library

== Connecting Bookshop to CloudCannon

NOTE: This guide assumes that your site is already set up with CloudCannon. If this isn't the case, hop over to the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-your-first-site/?ssg={ssg}[CloudCannon Documentation] and get setup with a successful build first.

Now that you understand how everything works locally, we can integrate Bookshop with CloudCannon. Bookshop does most of the heavy lifting for you, so we'll get to see the benefits pretty quickly. +
The main thing you need to do is create a link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/?ssg={ssg}[postbuild script] that runs Bookshop's generate script. This should be placed inside a folder named `.cloudcannon` at the root of your repository.

.*.cloudcannon/postbuild*
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
npm i
npx @bookshop/generate
----

This command will automatically discover your component library as well as the output site from your build, and will then generate CloudCannon Structures for your components.
ifndef::sveltekit[]
This step will also connect live editing to any pages on your site that contain Bookshop components.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifdef::sveltekit[]
Bookshop does not handle live editing for SvelteKit websites, as this is supported natively with CloudCannon and SvelteKit. See link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/live-editing-with-svelte/?ssg=SvelteKit[Live editing with Svelte] on the CloudCannon documentation.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifdef::hugo[]
With Hugo, there is one extra step to get live editing working. For any components or helpers in your Hugo layouts, you will need to use the `bookshop_bindings` partial to connect it to the page's front matter. 

For most setups, your site layouts will only contain the `page` helper, so this snippet will be all you need:

.*<layout>.html*
[source,go]
----
{{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `.Params.content_blocks` }}
{{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "page" .Params.content_blocks) }}
----

If you're using other components in your layouts, add the `bookshop_bindings` partial to them. This partial needs to be passed a string representation of the data being passed to the component that follows it. For example:

.*<layout>.html*
[source,go]
----
{{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `(dict hero_text .Params.hero_text)` }}
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "hero" (dict hero_text .Params.hero_text)) }}
----

WARNING: Hugo has a built-in option to minify output files, which is enabled by adding the `--minify` flag to the `hugo` command. Be sure to keep the HTML comments though (`keepComments = true`), or else Bookshop will not be able to generate the correct page bindings. Refer to the link:https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configure-minify[Hugo documentation] for more information.
endif::hugo[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
With that in place, live editing should work in CloudCannon. If you have the following front matter on a page:

```yaml
---
content_blocks:
---
```

And the `page` helper listed above in your layout, then in the CloudCannon sidebar you should be able to add our sample component and see it render live on the page.

TIP: If something isn't working, browse through our link:https://github.com/CloudCannon/{ssgl}-bookshop-starter/[{ssg} Bookshop Starter Template] to see how everything is configured.

endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
=== Using Editable Regions for Live Editing

Bookshop supports integration with link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/visual-editing-for-arrays/[CloudCannon's Editable Regions] as an alternative approach to live editing. This integration provides a more streamlined editing experience that relies on CloudCannon's native visual editing capabilities.

To enable this mode, add the `--editable-regions` flag to your postbuild script:

.*.cloudcannon/postbuild*
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
npm i
npx @bookshop/generate --editable-regions
----

When using this flag, Bookshop will inject a reduced live editing script that works with Editable Regions for rendering components. This also automatically disables data binding panels, as Editable Regions handle editing through CloudCannon's visual interface.

==== Updating Your Page Component

When using Editable Regions mode, you'll need to update your shared page helper to include the appropriate Editable Region attributes. Here's an example of what the updated `page.{ssgext}` helper should look like:

ifdef::hugo[]
.*layouts/base.html*
```go
<editable-component data-prop="content_blocks" data-component="page">
  {{ partial "bookshop" (slice "page" (dict "content_blocks" .Params.content_blocks)) }}
</editable-component>
```

.*component-library/shared/hugo/page.hugo.html*
```go
<main data-editable="array" data-prop="" data-id-key="_bookshop_name" data-component-key="_bookshop_name">
  {{ range .content_blocks }}
    <editable-array-item data-component="{{._bookshop_name}}" data-id="{{._bookshop_name}}">
      {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
    </editable-array-item>
  {{ end }}
</main>
```
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
.*layouts/base.html*
```liquid
<editable-component data-prop="content_blocks" data-component="page">
  {% bookshop_include page content_blocks=page.content_blocks %}
</editable-component>
```

.*component-library/shared/jekyll/page.jekyll.html*
```liquid
<main data-editable="array" data-prop="" data-id-key="_bookshop_name" data-component-key="_bookshop_name">
  {% for block in include.content_blocks %}
    <editable-array-item data-component="{{block._bookshop_name}}" data-id="{{block._bookshop_name}}">
      {% bookshop {{block._bookshop_name}} bind=block %}
    </editable-array-item>
  {% endfor %}
</main>
```
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
.*layouts/base.html*
```liquid
<editable-component data-prop="content_blocks" data-component="page">
  {% bookshop_include "page" content_blocks: content_blocks %}
</editable-component>
```

.*component-library/shared/eleventy/page.eleventy.liquid*
```liquid
<main data-editable="array" data-prop="" data-id-key="_bookshop_name" data-component-key="_bookshop_name">
  {% for block in content_blocks %}
    <editable-array-item data-component="{{block._bookshop_name}}" data-id="{{block._bookshop_name}}">
      {% bookshop "{{block._bookshop_name}}" bind: block %}
    </editable-array-item>
  {% endfor %}
</main>
```
endif::eleventy[]

The key additions are:

* `data-editable="array"` on the container element defines an Array Editable Region
* `data-id-key="_bookshop_name"` identifies the field used as a unique identifier for each array item
* `data-component-key="_bookshop_name"` tells CloudCannon which field contains the component name for each item
* `<editable-array-item>` wraps each component with the appropriate Editable Region attributes

For more information on configuring Editable Regions for different use cases, see the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/visual-editing-for-arrays/[CloudCannon Editable Regions documentation] and the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/visual-editing-for-components/[Visual Editing for Components guide].

NOTE: When using Editable Regions mode, you cannot use Bookshop's standard data bindings. The two approaches are mutually exclusive.

endif::sveltekit[]

=== Data Bindings

ifndef::sveltekit[]
Once you have components rendered on the page, Bookshop will create link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/?ssg={ssg}[Visual Data Bindings] automatically.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifdef::sveltekit[]
If you're using the link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/live-editing-with-svelte/?ssg=SvelteKit[CloudCannon Svelte live rendering], Bookshop can automatically create link:https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/?ssg={ssg}[Visual Data Bindings] for your components. To do so, you need to import `trackBookshopLiveData` and wrap the object that is provided from `onCloudCannonChanges`:

```svelte
<script>
	import { onDestroy, onMount } from "svelte";
	import {

If a component is passed data from the page front matter, you will be able to interact with that component directly on the page. 

By default, Bookshop will add bindings for any components on the page, but will not add bindings for shared helper files. This prevents Bookshop rendering data bindings around our shared `page` helper, so that the components within are immediately accessible.

This behavior can be customised by including a flag in the component's data. Bookshop will look for any of the following keys:

* data_binding
* dataBinding
* _data_binding
* _dataBinding

For example:


ifdef::hugo[]
```go
<!-- This component will **not** get a binding -->
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "item" (dict "data_binding" false "props" props)) }}

<!-- This partial **will** get a binding -->
{{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "page" (dict "data_binding" true "props" props)) }}
```
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
```liquid
<!-- This component will **not** get a binding -->
{% bookshop item data_binding=false props=props %}

<!-- This include **will** get a binding -->
{% bookshop_include page data_binding=true props=props %}
```
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
```liquid
<!-- This component will **not** get a binding -->
{% bookshop 'item' data_binding: false props: props %}

<!-- This include **will** get a binding -->
{% bookshop_include 'page' data_binding: true props: props %}
```
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::sveltekit[]
```liquid
<!-- This component will **not** get a binding -->
<Bookshop component="item" dataBinding=false {...props} />

<!-- This include **will** get a binding -->
<Bookshop shared="page" dataBinding=true {...props} />
```
endif::sveltekit[]

NOTE: This flag only applies to the component directly and doesn't cascade down. Any subcomponents will follow the standard rules, or can also specify their own Data Binding flag.

To disable all data bindings on your site, you can add the flag `--disable-bindings` to your `@bookshop/generate` command in your site's `postbuild`. This can significantly improve rendering performance for complex sites.

=== Live Editing Site Data and Collections

ifdef::sveltekit[]
In other SSGs, Bookshop drives the live editing experience. For SvelteKit, this is (currently) outside the scope of Bookshop.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]

The `npx @bookshop/generate` command connects Bookshop to a subset of your site's data when live editing.

ifdef::hugo[]

Data will not be available through `.Site.Data`, but will be available through `site.Data`. Accessing site pages when live editing is not yet supported in Hugo.

IMPORTANT: For data to be accessible, you will need to set `data_config: true` in your CloudCannon Global Configuration file.

endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]

Accessing `site.data` should then work as expected inside a component in the visual editor.

Accessing `site.<collection>` should also work out of the box. All front matter from a collection should be accessible, but some collection fields such as `page.content` and `page.excerpt` will not be available when live editing.

IMPORTANT: For data to be accessible, you will need to set `data_config: true` in your CloudCannon Global Configuration file.

NOTE: Support is only provided for data files in your source. Any data provided by a plugin will not be available.

endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]

Accessing your site data should then work as expected inside a component in the visual editor.

Accessing `collections.*` should also work out of the box. All front matter from a collection should be accessible, but some collection fields such as `templateContent` will not be available when live editing.

IMPORTANT: For data to be accessible, you will need to expose each data set using `data_config` in your CloudCannon Global Configuration file.

NOTE: Support is only provided for data files in your source. Any data provided by a plugin will not be available.

=== Passing Data to Bookshop Components

ifdef::sveltekit[]
In other SSGs, Bookshop drives the live editing experience. For SvelteKit, this is (currently) outside the scope of Bookshop.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
In order to live edit Bookshop components, Bookshop needs a clear path between a component and the data it draws from. In general, you should avoid adding logic around your Bookshop components in your site layouts, and instead move that logic into a Bookshop component or helper.

An example:


ifdef::hugo[]
.*index.md*
```yaml
---
hero_text: "Hello World"
---
```
.*index.html*
```go
<!-- 
  This component can make the connection between "text" and ".Params.hero_text",
  and will work as expected in the visual editor.
-->
{{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `(dict "text" .Params.hero_text)` }}
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "hero" (dict "text" .Params.hero_text)) }}

{{ my_title := .Params.hero_text }}

<!-- 
  This component does not have the context to map text back to its origin,
  and will error in the visual editor.
  (Assignments _inside_ Bookshop components will work correctly)
-->
{{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `(dict text $my_title)` }}
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "hero" (dict "text" $my_title)) }}
```

The same is true for site data. Access this directly from inside your component, rather than passing it to the component from your layout.
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
.*index.html*
```liquid
---
hero_text: "Hello World"
---
<!-- 
  This component can make the connection between "text" and the front matter,
  and will work as expected in the visual editor.
-->
{% bookshop hero text=page.hero_text %}

{% assign my_title = hero_text %}

<!-- 
  This component doesn't have the context to map text back to its origin,
  and will error in the visual editor.
  (Assignments _inside_ Bookshop components will work correctly)
-->
{% bookshop hero text=my_title %}
```

The same is true for site data and collections. Access these directly from inside your component, rather than passing them to the component from your layout.
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
.*index.html*
```liquid
---
hero_text: "Hello World"
---
<!-- 
  This component can make the connection between "text" and the front matter,
  and will work as expected in the visual editor.
-->
{% bookshop 'hero' text: hero_text %}

{% assign my_title = hero_text %}

<!-- 
  This component doesn't have the context to map text back to its origin,
  and will error in the visual editor.
  (Assignments _inside_ Bookshop components will work correctly)
-->
{% bookshop 'hero' text: my_title %}
```

The same is true for site data and collections. Access these directly from inside your component, rather than passing them to the component from your layout.

Bookshop's Jekyll live editing is built on top of the liquidjs package. As such, not all Jekyll features are supported within Bookshop components. Generally, functions that interact with Jekyll or the site as a whole are unavailable. The following features have been re-implemented for live editing in Jekyll:

|Filter: `markdownify`
|ℹ️ Uses a different markdown engine, so output isn't guaranteed to match Jekyll 1:1

|Accessing `site.data` and `site.<collection>`
|ℹ️ Iterating through collections and data files should be possible when live editing Bookshop components.

ifdef::hugo[]

Bookshop's Hugo editing is based upon a subset of Hugo running in the browser. As such, not all Hugo features will be available within Bookshop components.

As a general rule: Functions that access files directly (such as `resources.Get`), or access other parts of the site (such as `site.GetPage`), will not return anything useful in the visual editor.

If you're encountering an unsupported function, such as finding that `resources.Get` returns `nil`, see <<Rendering Different Content When Live Editing>>

endif::hugo[]

=== Rendering Different Content When Live Editing

ifdef::sveltekit[]
In other SSGs, Bookshop drives the live editing experience. For SvelteKit, this is (currently) outside the scope of Bookshop.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
You can render special content in the live editing environment by checking the Bookshop Live Editor flag. This can be useful to show extra information to your editors, or to use a feature that isn't supported while live editing.

ifdef::hugo[]
```go
{{ if site.Params.env_bookshop_live }}
  <p>I am being edited live!</p>
  <h1>Fallback {{ .my_page }} title</h1>
{{ else }}
  <p>Standard build output</p>
  <h1>{{ with site.GetPage .my_page }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }}</h1>
{{ end }}
```
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
```liquid
{% if env_bookshop_live %}
  <p>I am being edited live!</p>
  <h1>Fallback Title</h1>
{% else %}
  <p>Standard build output</p>
  <h1>{% my_plugin %}</h1>
{% endif %}
```
endif::eleventy[]
ifdef::jekyll[]

{% if env_bookshop_live %}
  <p>I am being edited live!</p>
  <h1>Fallback Title</h1>
{% else %}
  <p>Standard build output</p>
  <h1>{% my_plugin %}</h1>
{% endif %}
```

=== Disabling Live Editing

ifdef::sveltekit[]
In other SSGs, Bookshop drives the live editing experience. For SvelteKit, this is (currently) outside the scope of Bookshop.
endif::sveltekit[]

ifndef::sveltekit[]
Some components won't be compatible with live editing, in this case you can disable live editing with on a flag in the component's data. This is intended for components such as navigation and footer blocks that aren't connected to live editing. In most scenarios, you should use the templating flags in <<Rendering Different Content When Live Editing>>.

IMPORTANT: This setting will only apply if the component is rendered directly from a site layout. If this component is within another component, it will still update live (as the parent re-rendering will encapsulate it).

Bookshop will look for any of the following keys on a **top-level** component:

* live_render
* liveRender
* _live_render
* _liveRender

For example:


ifdef::hugo[]
```go
<!-- This component will re-render in the visual editor -->
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "navigation" (dict "props" props)) }}

<!-- This component will **not** re-render in the visual editor -->
{{ partial "bookshop" (slice "navigation" (dict "live_render" false "props" props)) }}
```
endif::hugo[]
ifdef::jekyll[]
```liquid
<!-- This component will re-render in the visual editor -->
{% bookshop navigation props=props %}

<!-- This component will **not** re-render in the visual editor -->
{% bookshop navigation live_render=false props=props %}
```
endif::jekyll[]
ifdef::eleventy[]
```liquid
<!-- This component will re-render in the visual editor -->
{% bookshop 'navigation' props: props %}

<!-- This component will **not** re-render in the visual editor -->
{% bookshop 'navigation' live_render: false props: props %}
```
endif::eleventy[]

If you have a specific component that you never want to live edit, you can set `_live_render` in the component's blueprint.

NOTE: Since the blueprint only affects the creation of new components, you will need to add the `_live_render` flag to any existing component data in your front matter.
