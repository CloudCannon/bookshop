IMPORTANT: Hugo support should be treated as a semi-stable beta

== Quick start
To jump right into using Bookshop on a Hugo site, check out the link:https://github.com/CloudCannon/hugo-bookshop-starter[Hugo Bookshop Starter] 

== Hugo Configuration

To use Bookshop with Hugo, the primary dependency is the `bookshop/hugo` module. This provides the bookshop partials needed to render components on your website. This import should be placed in your **site** config.toml.

.*site/config.toml*
```toml
[[module.imports]]
path = 'github.com/cloudcannon/bookshop/hugo/v2'
```

To pull in a specific version, use `go get`. i.e. `go get github.com/cloudcannon/bookshop/hugo/v2@2.4.0`.

The best workflow is then to create a new Hugo module to house your components. This can then be used across multiple websites using the Hugo module system.

.*bash*
```bash
hugo mod init github.com/example/components
```

The file structure within this components module is described in the link:conventions.adoc[Conventions Guide]

The last piece of config is adding the following mounts to the `config.toml` in your **components** module.

.*components/config.toml*
```toml
[[module.mounts]]
source = "."
target = "layouts/partials/bookshop"

[[module.mounts]]
source = "."
target = "assets/bookshop"
```

These mounts allow the `bookshop/hugo` module to locate your components.

See the link:https://github.com/CloudCannon/hugo-bookshop-starter[Hugo Bookshop Starter] for an example of how all of the above looks in practice.

== Writing components

Let's look at an example `button.hugo.html` file.
```
components/
└─ button/
   └─ button.hugo.html
```
These files are namespaced for the static site generator when the filetype is ambiguous, which is why the file is `button.hugo.html` and not `button.html`. Beyond the naming convention, these files are what you would expect when working with Hugo. Our `button.hugo.html` file might look like:
```go
<a class="c-button" href="{{ .link_url }}">{{ .text }}</a>
```
This looks like a normal Hugo include because... it is. While Bookshop provides developer tooling, the job of the `bookshop/hugo` module is to tell Hugo where to find component files. Loading and parsing these files goes through the normal Hugo partial flow.

TIP: The `@bookshop/init` package helps create component structures for you. Running `npx @bookshop/init --component button` would create the button structure needed for Hugo.

== Using components

To use components directly in a template, use the `bookshop` partial.

.*index.html*
```html
...
<div class="hero">
  {{ partial "bookshop" (slice "hero" (dict "title" .Params.title "image" .Params.image)) }}
  {{ partial "bookshop" (slice "button" (dict "label" .Params.cta_text "link_url" .Params.cta_url)) }}
</div>
...
```

This tag expects a slice where the first element is the Bookshop key of a component, and the second element is the value to pass to the component.

To render a list of components, you can pass a structure or an array of structures to the `bookshop` partial:
If your component is coming from front-matter and has a `_bookshop_name` field, you can pass that object directly to the `bookshop` partial.

.*index.html*
```html
---
components:
  - _bookshop_name: hero
    title: "Hello World"
    image: /image.png
  - _bookshop_name: button
    cta_text: "Get Started"
    link_url: /
---
<div class="hero">
  {{ range .Params.components }}
    {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
  {{ end }}
</div>
```

TIP: _The structures generated by Bookshop for CloudCannon include the `_bookshop_name` field for you. If you're not using structures you will need to add the `_bookshop_name` key by hand_

== Using Bookshop Partials

Bookshop partials can be placed in the `shared/hugo` directory. i.e:
```text
component-library/
├─ components/
└─ shared/
  └─ hugo/
    └─ helper.hugo.html
```

This can then be included using the `bookshop` partial with the `partial` syntax:
```html
  {{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "helper" (dict "lorem" "ipsum")) }}
```

The arguments are the same as the `bookshop` partial. This is otherwise a standard Hugo partial, with the extra feature that it can be used anywhere within your Hugo site _or_ your components.

== Importing styles

To import Bookshop styles in Hugo, the plugin provides a `bookshop_scss` partial, which returns a slice of all SCSS resources in your bookshop. This can then be used as such:

.*baseof.html*
```html
{{ $bookshop_scss_files := partial "bookshop_scss" . }}
{{ $scss := $bookshop_scss_files | resources.Concat "css/bookshop.css" | resources.ToCSS | resources.Minify | resources.Fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $scss.Permalink }}">
```

== Live Editing with Hugo

Live editing on CloudCannon works mostly out of the box with Bookshop and Hugo. The one piece of information needed is the entry point from a site layout into a component.

This takes the form of the `bookshop_bindings` partial:
```html
  {{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `(dict title .Params.title)` }}
  {{ partial "bookshop" (slice "hero" (dict title .Params.title)) }}


  {{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `.Params.content_blocks` }}
  {{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "page" .Params.content_blocks) }}
```

The `bookshop_bindings` partial should be given a string representation of the data passed to the bookshop tag. This allows Bookshop to connect that component with the correct front-matter values when visual editing. This tag is only needed in your site layouts — a Bookshop component using another Bookshop component does not need explicit `bookshop_bindings`.

---

If your layout is rendering a loop of components, that loop will need to exist within a Bookshop component or partial so that new components can be rendered when visual editing. This tend to be in the form of a `page.hugo.html` partial in the `shared/hugo` folder of your Bookshop module:

.*bookshop/shared/hugo/page.hugo.html*
```html
{{ range . }}
  {{ partial "bookshop" . }}
{{ end }}
```

Used in your layout:
.*baseof.html*
```html
{{ partial "bookshop_bindings" `.Params.content_blocks` }}
{{ partial "bookshop_partial" (slice "page" .Params.content_blocks) }}
```

=== Configuring Live Editing and Structures

The CloudCannon integration is enabled by the `@bookshop/generate` package. After building your site on CloudCannon, `npx @bookshop/generate` will configure the site for live editing. The recommended script to add is:

.*.cloudcannon/postbuild*
```html
# Clean the npm .bin for CI
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json

# Install and run generate
npm i
npx "@bookshop/generate"
```

This will add your component structures to the CMS, and configure live editing on all pages that contain Bookshop components.

=== Hugo Live Editing Support

Bookshop's Hugo live editing is built on top of the core Go text/template package. As such, not all Hugo features are supported within Bookshop components. Generally, functions that interact with Hugo or the site as a whole are unavailable. The following tables describe the features and functions currently supported in live-edited Bookshop components.

NOTE: Work is underway to expand support for many of the functions below. Open a GitHub issue if there is a specific function you need for your workflow.
