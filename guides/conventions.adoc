Bookshop relies on a strong set of conventions that encourage component isolation and maintenance. It should always be easy to find where a component is used, and discover where a component came from. +
In general, components should avoid side-effects and tight coupling with website styles, to encourage portability.  

== Configuration

A Bookshop project is a standalone component library, generally tailored to a specific static site generator. This project might live in a repository alongside your website, or it might live in its own repository and be vendored into your build.

A basic Bookshop project is expected to have the following structure:
```text
component-library/
├─ bookshop/
│  └─ bookshop.config.js
├─ components/
│  └─ component-name/
│     ├─ component-name.bookshop.toml
│     ├─ component-name.scss
│     └─ component-name.<framework>
└─ shared/
   ├─ styles/
   │  └─ **.scss
   └─ <framework>
      └─ **.<framework>
```

For a monorepo of company websites, the component library might sit alongside them like so:
```text
example-project/
├─ example-website-1/
├─ example-website-2/
└─ component-library/
```

TIP: The `@bookshop/init` package helps create component structures for you. Running `npx @bookshop/init --component button` in the `component-library` directory above would create the button structure for your chosen framework.

== Configuration

The `bookshop.config.js` file defines which framework(s) are available in the component library. This file is used to build out any developer tooling interfaces like the component browser.

.*bookshop.config.js*
```javascript
module.exports = {
    engines: {
        "@bookshop/jekyll-engine": {},   // If using Jekyll
        "@bookshop/eleventy-engine": {}  // If using Eleventy
    }
}
```

== Component Structure

Components live within the `components/` directory, each inside a folder bearing their name. A component is defined with a `<name>.bookshop.toml` file in the <<Component TOML Format>>. This file serves as the schema for the component, defining which properties it may be supplied.

For example, the `hero` component in our link:https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-bookshop-starter[Eleventy Bookshop Starter] is defined at:
```text
component-library/
└─ components/
   └─ hero/
      ├─ hero.bookshop.toml
      ├─ hero.eleventy.liquid
      └─ hero.scss
```

Components may also be nested within folders, which are then referenced as part of the component name. For example, the following structure would define the components `button/large` and `button/small` _(But *not* `button`)_:
```text
components/
└─ button/
   ├─ large/
   │  └─ large.bookshop.toml
   └─ small/
      └─ small.bookshop.toml
```

Alongside the Bookshop TOML file, the component files are provided. For a button example, this might look like:
```text
components/
└─ button/
   ├─ button.bookshop.toml
   ├─ button.jekyll.html
   ├─ button.eleventy.liquid
   └─ button.svelte
```

`button.jekyll.html` and `button.eleventy.liquid` are both implementations of the `button` component markup, but they share the same SCSS file and TOML schema. Bookshop is designed to span static site generators, so in the future you might also write a `button.hugo.html` and a `button.jsx`, depending on the generators your component library is targeting.  

== Component TOML Format

A Bookshop TOML file defines the schema for a given component. This schema is then used when previewing components in the Bookshop, and for configuring editing interfaces.

The component TOML file for our button might look like the following:

.*button.bookshop.toml*
```toml
[component]
structures = [ "editor_components" ]
label = "Button"
description = "Outbound CTA links"
icon = "smart_button"
tags = [ "Subcomponents", "CTAs" ]

[props]
label.default = "Get Started"
type.select = ["Standard", "Outline"]
type.default = "Standard"
link_url = "/"
open_in_new_tab = false
```

The `[component]` object defines this component, and is used to configure page building interfaces. The component fields are the following:

structures:: What types of structure to categorise this component as. This determines where editors can place components on your website.
label:: Editor-friendly name
description:: Editor-friendly description
icon:: The name of a material icon that represents your component
tags:: Editor-friendly tags to filter components by

The `[props]` object defines the component schema. This controls what properties it can receive, and is used to configure editing interfaces. The props of our button file above would correspond to the following usage in Eleventy:

```liquid
{% bookshop button 
   label: "Get Started" 
   type: "Standard" 
   link_url: "/" 
   open_in_new_tab: false %}
```

Or the following representation in front-matter:

```yaml
- _bookshop_name: button
  label: "Get Started"
  type: "Standard"
  line_url: "/"
  open_in_new_tab: false
```

=== TOML Schema Keys

Within the TOML file, two special keywords are `select` and `default` within an object. These denote that the object they're within should be treated instead as a value with a specified behaviour.

==== Default Values

*The field `default` is a special keyword in Bookshop, which denotes a field as having a default value when created in the CMS.*

By default, values in the TOML file are considered testing data, and new components created in a CMS interface will be initialized with empty inputs. If you do wish to give a field a default value for editors, use `key.default`
```toml
title.default = "Hello World"
order_number.default = 50
featured = false
```
This will prepopulate a new component in the CMS with `title: "Hello World"` and `order_number: 50`.  
The default key is not required for boolean values, as the value specified in the TOML will be used as the default CMS value.  

NOTE: _A default value in the TOML file does not provide a default value to the component itself. It is solely used to configure editing interfaces._

==== Select Data

*The field `select` is a special keyword in Bookshop, which denotes a field as drawing from select data (a dropdown).*

This key defines an array of options that will be used to populate the CMS.
```toml
size.select = ["Large", "Medium", "Small"]
```
In this example, the component might then receive the property `size="Large"`. Dropdowns are initialized empty, if you wish to also define a default selected state, combine the `select` and `default` keywords:
```toml
size.select = ["Large", "Medium", "Small"]
size.default = "Medium"
```

==== Objects

An object that doesn't contain the keys `select` or `default` will be treated as a normal object.
```toml
[props]
post.name = "Hello World"

# is equivalent to

[props]
[props.post]
name = "Hello World"
```

==== Structures

Constructing an array of objects in the TOML file defines a sub-schema for the CMS. Given the following structure:
```toml
[props]
title = "Hello World"

[[props.buttons]]
label.default = "Get Started"
link_url = "/app"
```
The CMS should provide an array named `buttons` within the component, to which buttons may be added or removed. Within these objects all Bookshop schema keys behave the same, and these sub-structures may define their own sub-structures again, i.e. with `\[[props.buttons.styles]]`

NOTE: The first array object in the TOML file will be used to build the schema for the sub-structure.

NOTE: A structure array will be initialized empty.

==== Comments

Editor-facing comments can be defined for a key via a comment starting with `#:` on the same line. For example:
```toml
title = "Hello World" #: Looks best under 35 characters
type.select = ["Primary", "Secondary"] #: Defines button hierarchy
```
These should then be available in the CMS when editing component data.

== Styles

SCSS files within a project do not need to be individually referenced, and are instead loaded automatically. Styles within `shared/` are loaded before styles within `/components` — within each folder, files are loaded alphabetically.

CAUTION: Bookshop SCSS is implementation agnostic. Bookshop interfaces use Dart Sass, but the generator ingesting components may use another implementation (i.e. Jekyll currently uses libsass). +
If you require specific Dart Sass features, use the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bookshop/sass[@bookshop/sass] package to compile the styles for your website build.
